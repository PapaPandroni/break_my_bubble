## Original Core Data Structures (IMPLEMENTED & ENHANCED ✅)

### ✅ NewsSource Interface (Enhanced)
Originally planned 3-point scale, implemented 5-point scale:
```typescript
// Original concept:
politicalLean: 'left' | 'center' | 'right';

politicalLean: 'left' | 'lean-left' | 'center' | 'lean-right' | 'right' | 'unknown';
```

### ✅ Article Interface (Enhanced)
Original basic structure enhanced with NewsAPI features:
```typescript
// Original concept achieved + enhanced with:
imageUrl?: string;     // Article images
author?: string;       // Author information
content?: string;      // Content previews
```

### ✅ Additional Interfaces (Added Beyond Scope)

- **Enhancement**: Added international sources from 12+ countries

### Topics with Keywords
- **Originally Planned**: 5 topics ✅
- **Actually Implemented**: 5 topics with enhanced keyword sets ✅
- **Topics**: Climate Change, Healthcare, Immigration, Economy, Technology ✅

## Original User Flow (IMPLEMENTED & ENHANCED ✅)
1. **Source Selection**: User enters 3-5 preferred news sources ✅ (Enhanced to 1-5 with dynamic discovery)
2. **Topic Selection**: User chooses ONE topic from predefined list ✅
3. **Time Range**: User selects timeframe via slider (24 hours to 1 month) ✅ (Enhanced with custom date ranges)
4. **Analysis**: App fetches RSS feeds and filters by topic and timeframe ✅ (Enhanced with NewsAPI)
5. **Results**: Display headlines from user's sources vs. opposing perspectives side-by-side ✅ (Significantly enhanced)

## Original Key Features to Implement (ALL COMPLETED ✅)

### ✅ RSS Feed Handling (COMPLETED & ENHANCED)
- **CORS Solution**: Using `https://api.allorigins.win/get?url=` ✅
- **XML Parsing**: Parse RSS XML to extract title, description, link, pubDate ✅
- **Caching**: Cache RSS data for 30 minutes to avoid excessive requests ✅
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures when RSS feeds are unavailable ✅
- **ENHANCEMENT**: Added NewsAPI integration as primary mode with RSS fallback

### ✅ Content Filtering (COMPLETED & ENHANCED)
- **Keyword Matching**: Case-insensitive search in title and description ✅
- **Date Filtering**: Filter articles by selected timeframe ✅ (Enhanced with custom ranges)
- **Deduplication**: Remove similar articles based on title similarity ✅
- **ENHANCEMENT**: Advanced relevance scoring and opposing perspective algorithms

### ✅ Results Display (COMPLETED & SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED)
- **Side-by-Side Layout**: User's sources on left, opposing sources on right ✅
- **Visual Distinction**: Different colors/styling for left/center/right sources ✅ (Enhanced to 5-point system)
- **External Links**: All article links open in new tabs ✅
- **Empty States**: Handle cases with no matching articles gracefully ✅
- **ENHANCEMENTS**: Added images, author info, content previews, enhanced error states

## Original Style Guide (IMPLEMENTED & ENHANCED ✅)
